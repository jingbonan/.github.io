 

I am currently an associate professor at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research bridges multiple disciplines, combining geochemistry, materials chemistry, and astrobiology. Specifically, my work focuses on abiotic organic synthesis and its implications for the origin of life, the preservation and abiotic alteration of Archean biosignatures, and the role of critical bio-essential metal deposition in the evolution of planetary habitability. Leveraging my interdisciplinary expertise, I adopt a multifaceted approach that integrates advanced micro- and nanoscale observational techniques, including electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nanoIR, ToF-SIMS, and nanoSIMS. These are complemented by experimental methods, such as in situ photothermal reactors and high-temperature, high-pressure silica tubes, as well as numerical modeling using DFT. This integrated methodology allows me to uncover complex interactions between organic materials and minerals in specific planetary environments, providing insights into fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of life.
