  General description: Studying the origin and evolution of early life on Earth is crucial for understanding the evolution of habitable conditions on Earth and exploring extraterrestrial life. The Archean Banded Iron Formations (BIF) and stromatolites preserve various clues of early life activities, but these clues are often influenced by later abiotic processes, including fluid alteration and prograde metamorphism, posing significant challenges in interpreting early life records. To overcome these challenges and accurately identify life signals in the burial windows of early life, this project focuses on typical Archean BIF and stromatolites, using a variety of in-situ geochemical proxies and high-precision microanalytics. The aim is to precisely identify organic matter records related to early life activities and delve into the impact of abiotic processes on the geochemical information of biogenic organic matter. The research pathways of the project include the comprehensive application of various organic matter trace element-molecular geochemical proxies to reveal early life information preserved within, exploring the spatial correlation between the geochemical characteristics of organic matter and surrounding specific minerals on multiple scales. This approach will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of abiotic influences, thereby expanding and enriching research methods concerning early life records on Earth. It provides new perspectives on the origin and early evolution of life on Earth, and offers insights for the exploration of potential life signals on other rocky planets.
